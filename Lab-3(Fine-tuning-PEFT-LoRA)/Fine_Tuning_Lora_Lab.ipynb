        "# Teaching AI to Answer Questions About Legal Documents 🤖📄\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're helping your parents understand a long contract they received. It's full of complicated words and takes long time to read! You wish you had a smart helper who could quickly find answers about what's in the contract. That's exactly what we're building - an AI assistant that can read and understand legal documents!\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Problem 🤔\n",
        "* Master Service Agreements (MSAs) are super long and confusing\n",
        "* Finding specific information (like \"What happens to customer data?\") takes too much time\n",
        "* Even when you find the right section, the legal language is hard to understand\n",
        "* People need quick, simple answers to their questions about these documents\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Solution! 🌟\n",
        "We're creating an AI helper that can:\n",
        "1. Read through entire legal documents\n",
        "2. Understand questions about the document\n",
        "3. Find the relevant information\n",
        "4. Give clear, simple answers\n",
        "\n",
        "## How We're Training Our AI 📚\n",
        "We're using:\n",
        "* A training dataset with lots of MSA examples and questions\n",
        "* A testing dataset to check how well our AI learns\n",
        "* Each example in our dataset includes:\n",
        "  - The document content (organized by page numbers)\n",
        "  - Questions about the document\n",
        "  - The correct answers\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we ask questions like:\n",
        "> \"Does this contract mention what happens to customer data after termination?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Special Teaching Method 🎯\n",
        "We're using a clever technique called LoRA that helps our AI learn quickly and efficiently. Think of it like:\n",
        "* Teaching someone to ride an electric bike when they already know how to ride a regular bike\n",
        "* They don't need to learn everything from scratch - just the new parts!\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Makes Our Project Special? ✨\n",
        "* Uses real legal documents (MSAs) for training\n",
        "* Focuses on practical, everyday questions people have about contracts\n",
        "* Makes legal documents more accessible to everyone\n",
        "* Can be improved over time with more training data"

        "- PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) is what makes our training efficient\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Do We Need These? 🤔\n",
        "Imagine building a house:\n",
        "- `transformers` is like having the main structure\n",
        "- `accelerate` is like having power tools instead of hand tools\n",
        "- `datasets` is like having an organized toolbox\n",

        "2. Without these, none of our later code will work\n",
        "3. It's like preparing your workspace before starting a project"

        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding language, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks can be challenging because of their enormous size and computational demands. This is where Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) comes in, offering an efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs without needing to adjust every parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of modifying the entire model, LoRA focuses on a small, manageable subset of parameters. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Normally, LLMs use a large matrix of parameters (W0) to make decisions. This matrix is huge and computationally expensive to adjust.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. LoRA introduces two smaller matrices, A and B, which are much narrower than W0. These matrices represent a low-rank update to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Instead of retraining the entire matrix W0, LoRA modifies only these smaller matrices, making the fine-tuning process much faster and more efficient. The result is a model update that’s nearly as effective as full fine-tuning but requires significantly fewer computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In a typical LLM layer, the output is calculated as output = W0x + b0. LoRA adds a new term, BAx, where A and B are the smaller matrices. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks without modifying the original large matrix W0.\n",

        "# Setting Up the Trainer: Key Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Purpose:**  \n",
        "   This code sets up a **Trainer** using the Hugging Face library to train a machine learning model efficiently with the necessary configurations and datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Main Components:**\n",
        "   - **Model:** The pre-trained `model` to be fine-tuned on the given dataset.\n",
        "   - **Datasets:**  \n",
        "     - `tokenized_train_dataset`: The data used for training the model.  \n",
        "     - `tokenized_validation_dataset`: The data used to evaluate the model's performance during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training Arguments:**  \n",
        "   These define how the training process will run:  \n",
        "   - **Output Directory:** Saves the model checkpoints and logs in `./phi-1_5-finetune-msa`.  \n",
        "   - **Epochs:** The model will train for 1 epoch (1 full pass through the training dataset).  \n",
        "   - **Warmup Ratio:** 10% of training steps used for learning rate warm-up.  \n",
        "   - **Batch Size:** Processes 4 samples per device during training and evaluation.  \n",
        "   - **Gradient Accumulation:** Accumulates gradients over 4 steps to reduce memory load.  \n",
        "   - **Gradient Checkpointing:** Saves memory during training.  \n",
        "   - **Max Steps:** Limits training to 100 steps.  \n",
        "   - **Learning Rate:** The learning rate is set to `5e-4`.  \n",
        "   - **FP16:** Enables mixed precision for faster training.  \n",
        "   - **Logging:** Logs training details every 10 steps in `./logs`.  \n",
        "   - **Save Strategy:** Saves model checkpoints every 50 steps.  \n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model every 50 steps and keeps the best model based on **loss**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Collator:**  \n",
        "   Uses the `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` to prepare batches without masked language modeling (`mlm=False`).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Training the Model:**  \n",
        "   - Finally, the `trainer.train()` command starts the training process using the configurations and datasets.\n",
